# Text-Generation
Tensorflow python model that generates text similar to a corpus. You can view some sample outputs at https://github.com/JBlitzar/Text-Generation/blob/main/sonnets/1000-epoch.txt and https://github.com/JBlitzar/Text-Generation/blob/main/sonnets/500-epoch_rhyming.txt. 

For best results, train for at least 500 epochs and have a corpus that is at least 200 KB. Training usually takes around 2 hours on a mac with 16gb of ram. Checkpointing system is included
